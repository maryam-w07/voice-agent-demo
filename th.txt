⚠️ TTS error: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified
almost always means one thing on Windows:

👉 FFmpeg is not installed or not found in PATH.
pydub requires FFmpeg to load/play MP3 files.

Your OpenAI TTS is working — the file is being generated —
but pydub cannot decode or play MP3, so it throws the WinError.

Let’s fix it cleanly.
